<summary>How can I adjust deadlines for assignments?</summary>

There are two major deadlines associated with an assignment. One is the *due
date*. This is displayed on each student's user page, and determines whether
work counts as late. The other is the *visible* date. After the *visible* date
passes, the assignment is no longer visible to the student, and can't be
accessed. You can configure both of these dates by pressing the small "gear"
icon that appears next to the assignment listing in the "manage assignments"
tab on the instructor page.

You can also adjust deadlines per-student in two ways. One is to offer the
student an extension. You can do this by clicking the "calendar plus" icon
that appears next to the student's name in the class roster on your instructor
page. The extension will override both the due-date and the visibility date for
that student. You can also set a deadline adjustment policy for a specific
student by clicking the "clock" icon next to the student's name.

<summary>How can I control student credit for late assignments?</summary>

By default, students receive half-credit (rounding down) for problems that are
submitted after the due date, but while the problem is still visible. However,
late credit is configurable using the `late-credit` option, which applies to
all exercises. You can set the `late-credit` option like this:

    ~~~{.SomeProblemType late-credit=4} 
    1.1 SOME PROBLEM
    ~~~

<summary>How can I control when grades are released?</summary>

Ordinarily, a student's score for a problem is visible (on the student's user
page) immediately after the student submits a problem. In some situations (for
example, during an exam), this can be undesirable.

If you want to release grades only after a certain time and date, then you can
set a "Release Grades After" time when you create the assignment. You can also
update this release time by pressing the "gear" icon next to the assignment on
your instructor page, in the "manage assignments" tab.
